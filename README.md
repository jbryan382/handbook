## 🚀 Quick start for contributors

1. **Enter the `web` directory.**

   ```shell
   cd web
   ```

1. **Install dependencies.**

   We use the `yarn` package manager.

   ```shell
   yarn install
   ```

1. **Start developing.**

   Navigate into the site’s directory and start it up.

   ```shell
   cd web
   yarn start
   ```

1. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   The handbook is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_.
   This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying data. Learn more about
   using this tool in the
   [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
