title: Style Guide
---

This is a work-in-progress style guide for authoring content in this handbook.
In addition to the rules stated here, as a general rule, we follow the
[AP Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) rules.

## General

- The use of first-person should be avoided, e.g. "I recommend selecting the
  third option."
- All file and directory names should be lower case with hyphenated words, e.g.
  `sql-joins`.
- Avoid use of temporal phrases like: "today, we discussed a new topic", or "in
  yesterday's assignment".

## Title Case

When writing titles anywhere in the handbook, e.g. for pages or headings, do
capitalize:

- The first and last word of the title
- All verbs, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs
- Words longer than three letters, including words you wouldn't otherwise
  capitalize

Don't capitalize short articles, prepositions, or conjunctions, i.e. less than
four letters long. Be mindful of short verbs, e.g. "is", "are", "was", and "be";
they are short words, but should still be capitalized.

## Assignments

- Follow the [assignment template](./assignment-template).
- Requirements should be stated in clear, _complete_ sentences, including
  punctuation:
  > Put your short essay into an HTML page, using appropriate semantic HTML
  > tags.
- Objectives may be stated as sentence fragments, without punctuation:
  > Create an event-driven user interface
