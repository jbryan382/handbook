# First Impression

- Employers look through 5 to 30+ portfolios when hiring
- Within 5 seconds they can see the type of visual craftsmanship

This means:
- A clear hierarchy of information
- Site needs to be simple and aesthetically pleasing
- The typography needs to be appropriate & readable

---

# Not a designer? That’s ok!

- Find a template & Own the template
- Better to use a template than attempt to be a designer and fail
- It’s better to be good than original
- Clever is great but can be really hard to pull off

# Display Your Work

- 3 - 5 projects
- Should be your best work and the best parts of your work
- Present it like  a project/work not an assignment
- If it doesn’t exist in the real world you can say it was a “concept”
- Try and have at least one real world project
- Don’t present anything you aren’t proud of - Own it or don’t show it
