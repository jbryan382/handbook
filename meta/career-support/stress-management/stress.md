# Why is it important?

Stress wreaks havoc on your emotional equilibrium & health

Stress narrows your ability to think clearly, function effectively, and enjoy life

Stress Management allows you to break the hold stress has on your life, so you can be happier, healthier, and more productive

Prioritize yourself as much as you would family, friends, and your career. (Or whatever else you consider important.)

# Tip 1: Identify the sources of stress

Easy to see stressor examples might be changing jobs, moving or relationship changes

- Do you explain away stress as temporary (“I just have a million things going on right now”) even though you can’t remember the last time you took a breather?

- Do you define stress as an integral part of your work or home life (“Things are always crazy around here”) or as a part of your personality (“I have a lot of nervous energy, that’s all”)?

# Tip 3: Get moving

Physical activity is a huge stress reliever and you don’t have to be an athlete or spend hours in a gym to experience the benefits. 

Exercise releases endorphins that make you feel good, and it can also serve as a valuable distraction from your daily worries

# Tip 4: Connect to others

Spend quality time with another human being who makes you feel safe and understood

Keep in mind that the people you talk to don’t have to be able to fix your stress. They simply need to be good listeners.

Reach out to a professional when you need more than just a friend

# Tip 5: Make time for fun / relaxation

[.column]
Don’t get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of life that you forget to take care of your own needs. 

- Nurturing yourself is a necessity, not a luxury.

- Do something you enjoy every day.

- Keep your sense of humor.

- Take up a relaxation practice.

# Tip 6: Manage your time better

Poor time management can cause a lot of stress. 

When you’re stretched too thin and running behind, it’s hard to stay calm and focused.

Don’t over-commit yourself.

Prioritize tasks.

Break projects into small steps.

# Tip 7: Maintain balance with a healthy lifestyle

**Watch what you eat**
- Fuel your body so it can work effectively

**Stay hydrated**

**Get enough sleep**
- A rested brain thinks better

# Tip 8: Learn to relieve stress in the moment
