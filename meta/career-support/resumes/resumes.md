**Summary** 

This section should be a brief paragraph (three to five sentences) that shows the value you bring by highlighting your skills and a couple big career wins. But rather than labeling it a “summary,” simply use a headline that encapsulates your credentials.

**Skills**

You’ll want to incorporate the right keywords so that your resume is optimized for application tracking systems

---
**Professional experience**

Focus on your accomplishments rather than your day-to-day responsibilities

**Education**

Simply write where you went college and your degree.
It’s ok to move this towards the top if you have limited work experience and want to highlight your experience at SDG

# One page vs Two page

**One page**
- Easier to read, resume readers have to look at a large number of resumes on a daily basis.

**Two pages**
- If you really think that it is critical to communicate the depth and breadth of your skills. Smart when the situation merits it. A general rule of thumb is that the applicant should be able to fit 10 years of work experience onto each page of your resume.

# Format Wisely

- Use a logical format and wide margins, clean type and clear headings

- Selectively apply bold and italic typeface that help guide the reader's eye

- Use bullets to call attention to important points (i.e. accomplishments)

---
# Identify Accomplishments

- It’s not just about Job Descriptions

- Focus on what you did in the job, NOT what your job was there's a difference

- Include a one or two top line job description first, then list your accomplishments

- Accomplishments should be unique to you, not just a list of what someone else did

- Avoid using the generic descriptions of the jobs you originally applied for or held

---
# Quantify Accomplishments

**What makes your accomplishment special?**

- Include and highlight specific achievements that present a comprehensive picture of your marketability

- Quantify your achievements to ensure greater confidence in the hiring manager and thereby generate interest percentages, dollars, number of employees, etc.

- Work backwards to quantify your accomplishments by asking, If I had not done X, what could have happened?

---
# Career Summary

**Replace your “Objective" with a "Career Summary"**

- Grab a hiring manager's attention right from the beginning, remembering you have only 25 few seconds to make a good impression

- Spend time developing a summary that immediately gets their attention, and accurately and powerfully describes you as a solution to their problems

# Templates

[.column]
**So are there any downfalls to using a template?**

- Become cookie-cutter and easy to recognize
- Use formatting techniques with headers, footers, and tables, which do not work well with ATS software

**So how can you use a template and still stand out?**

- Customize the font selections 
- Change up the colors
