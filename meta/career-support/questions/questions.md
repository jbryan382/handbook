# When should you ask?

If you're stuck, don't bang your head against the desk for too long. Reach out for help.

Make sure you are using the resources around you. Your peers, the Internet, the community are all available in addition to your instructor / mentor.

**Pomodoro Technique:** uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

# The Buddy System


Spend a reasonable amount of time trying to solve the issue yourself, but no more than that. 

What is reasonable? It depends on your task, it could be a few minutes (You've forgotten how to create a branch with git), or it could be a half an hour (You're stuck trying to get a click event working in a React component).

You've looked on the Internet, but no luck in solving your problem.

# The Buddy System

Ask a peer. Work together for a reasonable amount of time on it. If they've helped you solved it: great! You learned something new, and they've reinforced their own experience. It's a win-win.

If you and your peer are not able to solve it together, now is the time you should **both approach** the instructor for help.

# Talking to the Duck

- Obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety).

- Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if that’s all right.

- Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code line by line.

- 
At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realize that that is not in fact what you are actually doing.

# Tips

**Plan your questions:** Outline your information goals and a sequence of related questions to help you follow the conversation.

**Know your purpose:** Every question you ask should help you gather either facts or an opinion. Know which kind of information you need and frame your questions accordingly.

---
# Tips

**Open conversation:** Unlike simple yes-or-no questions, open-ended questions invite the respondent to talk — and enable you to gather much more information. 

**Speak your listener’s language:** Relate questions to the listener’s frame of reference and use words and phrases that your listener understands. 

---
# Tips

**Follow general questions with specific ones:** Build a hierarchy of questions that begins with the big picture and gradually drills down into specifics with follow-up questions.

**Focus your questions so they ask one thing at a time:** To get more complete answers, craft short questions, each of which covers a single point. If you really want to know two different things, ask two different questions.

---
# Tips

**Ask only essential questions:** If you don’t really care about the information that’s likely to come, don’t ask the question. Respect the other person’s time and attention to avoid appearing resistant to closing the deal.

**Don’t interrupt:** Listen to the full answer to your question. The art of good questioning lies in truly wanting the information that would be in the answer.
