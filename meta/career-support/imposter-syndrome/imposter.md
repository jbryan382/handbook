# What is Imposter Syndrome?

Psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud"

May be accompanied by anxiety, stress, or depression


^ Types of Imposter Syndrome (5 types)
- The Perfectionist
- The Superwoman/man
- The Natural Genius
- The Soloist
- The Expert

---
# The Perfectionist

Set excessively high goals for themselves, and when they fail to reach a goal, they experience major self-doubt and worry about measuring up

^ - Do you have great difficulty delegating?
- Do you feel like your work must be 100% perfect, 100% of the time?

# The Superwoman/man

Are convinced they’re phonies amongst real-deal colleagues, they often push themselves to work harder and harder to measure up

^ --------
- Do you stay later at the office than the rest of your team, even past the point that you’ve completed that day’s necessary work?
- Have you left your hobbies and passions fall by the wayside, sacrificed to work?

---
# The Natural Genius

Set their internal bar impossibly high, just like perfectionists. They judge themselves based on getting things right on the first try.

^ --------
- Are you used to excelling without much effort?
- Do you dislike the idea of getting help because you can handle things on your own?
- Does your confidence take a tumble when you don't perform well?

# The Soloist

Feel as though asking for help reveals their phoniness

^ --------
- Do you firmly feel that you need to accomplish things on your own?
- “I don’t need anyone’s help.” Does that sound like you?

---
# The Expert

Measure their competence based on “what” and “how much” they know or can do. 

Believing they will never know enough, they fear being exposed as inexperienced or unknowledgeable.

^ - Do you shy away from applying to job postings unless you meet every single educational requirement?
- Are you constantly seeking out trainings or certifications because you think you need to improve your skills in order to succeed?

# [fit] How do you move past it?

---
**Share your feelings**
- Talk to other people about how you are feeling. These irrational beliefs tend to fester when they are hidden and not talked about.

**Focus on others**
- While this might feel counterintuitive, try to help others in the same situation as you. If you see someone who seems awkward or alone, ask that person a question to bring him or her into the group. As you practice your skills, you will build confidence in your own abilities.

---
**Assess your abilities**
- If you have long-held beliefs about your incompetence in social and performance situations, make a realistic assessment of your abilities. Write down your accomplishments and what you are good at, and compare that with your self-assessment.

**Take baby steps**
- Don't focus on doing things perfectly, but rather do things reasonably well and reward yourself for taking action. For example, in a group conversation, offer an opinion or share a story about yourself.

---
**Stop comparing**
- Every time you compare yourself to others in a social situation, you will find some fault with yourself that fuels the feeling of not being good enough or not belonging. Instead, during conversations, focus on listening to what the other person is saying. Be genuinely interested in learning more.

**Use social media moderately**
- We know that the overuse of social media may be related to feelings of inferiority. If you try to portray an image on social media that doesn't match who you really are or that is impossible to achieve, it will only make your feelings of being a fraud worse.

---
**Stop fighting your feelings**
- Don't fight the feelings of not belonging. Instead, try to lean into them and accept them. It's only when you acknowledge them that you can start to unravel those core beliefs that are holding you back.

**Refuse to let it hold you back**
- No matter how much you feel like you don't belong, don't let that stop you from pursuing your goals. Keep going and refuse to be stopped.

Ask Questions

There are no bad questions, only gaps in knowledge you're looking to fill.

**When should you ask?**

- If you're stuck, don't bang your head against the desk for too long. Reach out for help.

- Make sure you are using the resources around you. Your peers, the Internet, the community are all available in addition to your instructor / mentor.

---

# Work with a Buddy

Spend a reasonable amount of time trying to solve the issue yourself, but no more than that. 

You've looked on the Internet, but no luck in solving your problem.

Ask a peer. Work together for a reasonable amount of time on it. 
- If they've helped you solved it: great! You learned something new, and they've reinforced their own experience. It's a win-win.
- If you and your peer are not able to solve it together, now is the time you should **both approach** the instructor for help.

# Talk to the Duck

- Obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety).

- Place rubber duck on desk

- Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code line by line.

- At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realize that that is not in fact what you are actually doing.

# Tips for Asking Questions

**Plan your questions:** Outline your information goals and a sequence of related questions to help you follow the conversation.

**Know your purpose:** Every question you ask should help you gather either facts or an opinion. Know which kind of information you need and frame your questions accordingly.

---

**Open conversation:** Unlike simple yes-or-no questions, open-ended questions invite the respondent to talk — and enable you to gather much more information. 

**Speak your listener’s language:** Relate questions to the listener’s frame of reference and use words and phrases that your listener understands. 

---

**Follow general questions with specific ones:** Build a hierarchy of questions that begins with the big picture and gradually drills down into specifics with follow-up questions.

**Focus your questions so they ask one thing at a time:** To get more complete answers, craft short questions, each of which covers a single point. If you really want to know two different things, ask two different questions.

---

**Ask only essential questions:** If you don’t really care about the information that’s likely to come, don’t ask the question. Respect the other person’s time and attention to avoid appearing resistant to closing the deal.

**Don’t interrupt:** Listen to the full answer to your question. The art of good questioning lies in truly wanting the information that would be in the answer.
