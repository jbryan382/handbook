# Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

> Taking your time with these projects is key to not getting frustrated. Also no
> need to stress for each assignment. Everything will workout at the end!

# Manage your stress and your time.

> Focus on developing stress and time management skills.

# Pace yourself

> I would advise them to be patient and pace yourself. It’s ok if you don’t get
> it right away, keep practicing and ask as many questions as possible.

> I would advise them to pace themselves and not to feel overwhelmed if they
> fall behind. This course throws a lot of information at you in a short amount
> of time, so you need to give yourself the time and space to understand the
> information before you can get the assignments finished.

> Take your time and do not panic if you start to feel overwhelmed. Just
> practice, practice, and keep practicing the techniques taught.

# Be mentally prepared if you fall behind

> Being overwhelmed at times negatively effected my performance. Being confident
> in your ability to learn things like we did in this course is a key attitude.

# Everyone is different

> I’d recommend that the students realize that every one is different, everyone
> learns at a different pace, learns in a different way, and will solve problems
> and write code differently. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and try your best
> to not feel over whelmed and if you are speak on it.

# Being frustrated is OK

> I would advise them that being frustrated is ok. The course is intense for a
> reason and learning to work with the frustration can be very helpful. Everyone
> goes through it.

# Ask questions!

> Biggest thing is ask lots of questions, because you will have a lot of
> questions. And the only way you will retain anything is to be curious about
> everything and keep asking questions.

> Don't be afraid to ask questions and make sure you understand the material.
> Rather than rushing through the homework to get it completed, fully
> understanding the concepts is crucial for your growth as a developer. Asking
> questions will also help you with understanding even better.

> Also, learn to reach out for help when necessary, it will save you so much
> time and help you truly understand the concept of the problem.

> For next cohort, I would tell them it is a long process of learning that never
> stops. I would tell them to not think that they are leaving knowing
> everything, but they are leaving with the skills to keep going. I would also
> tell them they are not alone and to ask for help ASAP. I have spent many times
> suffering in silence because I wanted to “figure things out on my own”. That’s
> what everyone is there for.

# Trust the process

> As for advice, I would say, don’t question yourself! In the words of the
> Philadelphia 76ers and Sam Hinkie - “Trust the process!”

> My advice to future cohorts would be to trust Gavin, your peers, and the
> process. It may not be readily apparent at the onset, but you are exactly
> where you need to be.

# PEDAC

> As for advice, I would recommend adapting PEDAC as soon as possible. I feel
> like it changed the way I looked at problems even though I've yet to master it
> myself.

# Share!

> Focus on sharing what you learned with others. It really helps reinforce what
> you know.
