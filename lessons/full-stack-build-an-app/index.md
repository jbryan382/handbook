In this lesson, we will be combining all of our skills from
`Introduction to Programming with C#` and
`Fundamentals of Front-end Web Development`. To do so we will build an
application that will let us track our favorite taco restaurants in town. As we
go we will incrementally add features to our application. The backend will be an
[API](/lessons/cs-api-servers) that we develop in `C#` using
[LINQ](/lessons/cs-linq) with
[Entity Framework](/lessons/cs-object-relational-mapping). The front end will be
a [React](/lessons/react-intro) application that will
[fetch data](/lessons/js-fetch) from our API and support multiple pages with
[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
