| Term                                              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `while` (condition)                               | This loop will continue running the code within its `{}` until the condition of the while loop is false.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `for` (Initialization; Condition; Afterthought)   | This loop contains an initialized variable, usually `i`, that is used in the condition. If this condition ever returns false the loop will terminate. The afterthought is an incremental increase or decrease of the initialized variable. ie. `i++` or `i--`. |
| `i++`                                             | Is the same as `i = i + 1`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `i--`                                             | Is the same as `i = i - 1`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `foreach` (var singleVariable in listOfVariables) | This loop starts at index 0 of a collection of variables ie. Lists or Arrays. Then "for each" variable in the list the code within the `{}` of the loop is executed.                                                                                           |
