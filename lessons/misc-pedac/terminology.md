| `P`  | Problem: Write out the problem that needs to be solved. Summary of expected outcome(s), and restraints of the problem.                                                                 |
| `E`  | Examples: Look at or create example data, and expected output.                                                                                                                         |
| `D`  | Data Types: Write out what variable types being used in the problem. Understand what your input variable type and the expected return type, and how the variable might need to change. |
| `A`  | Algorithm: Pseudocode or plain old English interpretation of each step of the program.                                                                                                 |
| `C`  | Code: Start coding the solution following the steps of the algorithm.                                                                                                                  |
