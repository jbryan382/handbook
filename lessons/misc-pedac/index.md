title: PEDAC - A problem solving approach
---

Many people assume that software developers (or call us: software engineers,
programmers, coders, etc.) are paid to write code. While writing code is
certainly one of the tasks we do, it is not really the part that adds the most
value.

What adds the most value is **solving problems**. We solve these problems in the
language of computer code. If we are hired to write a company's employee
database we are actually being paid to figure out all of the needs they have
involving keeping track of employees and to improve that situation through
solving the related problems and implementing it in code.

# A formal approach for solving problems

There is surprisingly little written about problem solving. One of the best
resources we have seen is
[this article from launch school](https://medium.com/launch-school/solving-coding-problems-with-pedac-29141331f93f).
It does an excellent job at specifying an approach to problem solving.

They call the approach `PEDAC` which stands for:

- Problem
- Examples
- Data Structure
- Algorithm
- Code

Their article is good and we recommend this approach any time you are solving a
programming related problem. This includes homework assignments as well as any
code challenges you do.

  [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-101-Simple-People/dp/1591842425)
  and [another book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It) about how to
  solve problems. Do _NOT_ feel compelled to buy these books.
