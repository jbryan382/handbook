Learning to break problems down into smaller pieces, thinking about data, and constructing algorithms is a critical step.

In this project, you will practice [PEDAC](/lessons/misc-pedac) without having to think about code yet.

## Objectives

- Practice the [PEDAC](/lessons/misc-pedac) approach.
- Thinking about data and algorithms free from the complications of also having to consider code.

## Requirements

- Either a deck of playing cards **OR** a set of notecards, post-it notes, or small pieces of paper.
- Paper and pencil or Visual Studio Code
- A friend or family member to help you when you are done with your assignment.

### Setup

If you are not using a deck of playing cards, take 20 notecards, post-it-notes, or small pieces of paper and label **ONE** side of them with the numbers one through 20.

If you are using a deck of playing cards, take 20 cards out of the deck.

Shuffle the cards/paper into a random order.

Lay the cards/paper out on a table to form a horizontal line leaving a little space between each.

### Explorer Mode

Using the [PEDAC](/lessons/misc-pedac) process create an algorithm to put the cards/paper in numerical order. For using cards consider the `ACE` to be a one, and consider `Jack`, `Queen`, `King` to be in that order.

Requirements:

- You may only turn over **TWO** cards at any time.
- You may only swap the position of **TWO** cards (that you have turned over) at any time.
- You may only refer to cards based on their position in your list (left-to-right). You may choose to refer to the position by `0` or by `1`, whichever you prefer.
- You may **NOT** keep track of the value of any cards in any manner other than by turning over **TWO** cards and considering their value. For instance, you may not "remember" any values, or write down their values elsewhere, etc.

- When you have your algorithm, test it until you are satisfied that it is as clear as you can make it.
- Take your cards/notes and shuffle them again, laying them out horizontally on the table again.
- Invite your friend or family member to follow your algorithm precisely. They may not ask you any clarifying questions. If they do not understand a step you must **STOP** and revise your algorithm and have them start **OVER** with a new sorted set of cards/paper.

- Turn in a copy of your PEDAC work including your final algorithm.
- Either turn in your text or turn in a link to a photo of your written work if you wrote your PEDAC on paper.

## Adventure Mode

- Does your algorithm work for 52 cards? 1000 cards?
- If not, what needs to be modified?

## Epic Mode

- Can you transform your algorithm into C# code?
- If so, see if you can use it to order a list of `int` values.
