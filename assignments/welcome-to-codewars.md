The best way to improve our problem-solving skills is to practice, practice, practice. Many developers continue to do frequent practice on small sample problems, some even using them as a daily warmup before beginning their daily routine.

One of the common interview scenarios for developers is a coding question or challenge. During an interview, you may be asked to code the solution to a small problem or you may be given a small application to create over a few days and turn in.

Both of these scenarios require you to begin a habit of practicing reading and solving coding exercises.

The website we'll be using for this is `https://codewars.com`

## Objectives

- Exercise and improve your problem-solving skills
- Prepare you for interview coding questions

## Requirements

- Create an account at [https://codewars.com](https://codewars.com)
- Join the "Suncoast Developers Guild" clan
- Create a new, empty, github repository to store your `codewars` solutions in

## Explorer Mode

- Choose any _TWO_ of the following code challenges.
- Complete them through the phase of "SUBMIT" and having codewars acknowledge your code is correct.
- Copy and paste the _code_ of your solution into a file in your `codewars` repository. Use a filename similar to the name of the challenge. For instance, if you solve "Switch it Up!" name your file "SwitchItUp.cs" or "switch-it-up.cs"
