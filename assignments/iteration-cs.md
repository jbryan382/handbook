title: Iteration in C#
tags: ['c-sharp', 'enumeration']
---

Learning programming takes practice and the best practice is repetition. This
exercise will allow you time to work on the basics of .NET and LINQ.

## Objectives

- Practice using LINQ to iterate/enumerate collections

## Instructions

_NOTE_ These instructions are slightly _different_ than your typical setup. This is because we are [forking](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) an existing code repository. You are making a copy FROM SDG's repository to your own. Then you are pulling DOWN that code from your github to start off the project.

To setup your assignment:

1. Click on [this repository](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/net-iteration) and then click the `Fork` button to make a copy in your own account.
2. In your terminal change into your projects directory. (e.g `cd ~/sdg`)
3. Clone your repository:
   `hub clone net-iteration`
4. Change into your project's directory: `cd net-iteration`
5. Install the dependencies: `dotnet restore`
6. Open in your editor: `code .`
7. Start the test runner: `dotnet watch run`
8. Open `Iterations.cs` and work on functions until the test passes. Once you are done with a test you can move to the next one. There are a total of 10 questions.
9. Commit and push your work to GitHub.
10. Turn in the URL to your GitHub repo.
