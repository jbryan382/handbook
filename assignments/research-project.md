As a developer, learning is a lifelong skill that you will continue to hone. During this class, you have learned many technologies, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. For this project, you will select a _new_ topic in technology and learn about it. You'll share what you've learned with us.

## Explorer Mode

- Select a topic that we did not cover in class, get it approved by your instructor, and research the subject to understand it
- Either:
  - Give a 10-15 minute presentation that includes:
    - What is the technology
    - What problem does the technology solve
    - Why makes the technology unique
    - Demonstrate a project built with that technology
  - Write a paper, between 10 and 15 pages in length, detailing the same areas as a presentation would
